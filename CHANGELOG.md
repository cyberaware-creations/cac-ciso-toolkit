# Changelog

Every released version of the CAC CISO toolkit, newest first.

**This file starts late, and that is the first thing worth recording.** The `v0.11.0` release
note said the repo had "run to 0.10.5 across 65 commits without one, so the version strings
were the only record of what an installed copy actually was." That problem was named, fixed
once with a single tag, and then recurred immediately: the repo ran from **0.12.0 to 0.37.0
across 28 versions** with no tag and no changelog. Those 28 tags were reconstructed from the
manifest history on 2026-08-07 and every one was verified to point at a tree whose manifest
declares that version. The entries below were written from the commits, not from notes taken
at the time — so they are accurate about *what* changed and thinner than they should be about
*why*.

The guard in `tools/check-versions.py` now fails a change that moves the version without
adding an entry here. A release step a human has to remember is not a check — the same
reasoning that put the four manifests under a guard in the first place.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. `0.13.0`–`0.15.0` never existed; the version jumped from
`0.12.0` to `0.16.0`.

## v0.39.0 — 2026-08-07

**`vendor-register`, skill #9** — third-party arrangements, with a criticality that is traced
rather than asserted. Plan 1 of two; the assessment layer follows.

- **Contract-centric, not vendor-centric.** One provider commonly holds several arrangements at
  different criticalities, and a vendor-shaped store forces one criticality per company.
- **Criticality is derived, then confirmed.** The walk traces what an arrangement supports back
  to a workflow whose criticality the business declared — two hops, following NISTIR 8179's
  Process E in shape. Derivation proposes; `--confirm` without `--by` is refused. A confirmed
  level that differs from the derived one is a *finding*, not an error, and escalates.
- **`untraced` is a value, not a gap.** Never `low`, not a member of the scale, and
  `criticality_rank` **raises** on it — one `sorted(key=rank)` placing it at the bottom would
  silently downgrade every untraceable arrangement behind a board table that looked complete. A
  truncated walk returns `untraced` *and* `truncated`, never a confident level from an
  unfinished walk. Mutation-tested three ways.
- **No vendor score**, under an eval with two halves: nothing emitted is named like one, and
  nothing computes one internally. Proven in both directions — a score renamed to
  `attentionIndex` escapes the first check and not the second.
- **Triggers fire at every criticality level.** `low` has no cadence by design, so a
  subprocessor change on a low arrangement is the only thing that catches it stopping being low.
- **The D-10 colour split**: criticality is RAG operationally, a classification on the board
  page, where RAG is reserved for what needs a decision. `untraced` is neutral on both and
  always carries its word.

Supporting changes:

- `business-context` crown jewels may declare `criticality` and `dependsOn`. Optional and
  additive — absent unless declared, so every `.biz` written before this exports byte-identically
  (asserted). This is where the walk's top hop lives, because how critical a workflow is, is a
  business judgement.
- `board-pack` gains a `vendor` section, **additive within `contractVersion: 1`** on the
  `boundTo` precedent. It sits after `risk` in both orderings — what we carry, then who we
  depend on to carry it — and both orderings are recorded as chosen rather than defaulted.
  A pack with no vendor sidecar is unchanged in every section, decision, headline and
  escalation; it gains one provenance line naming the section it does not have.

## v0.38.0 — 2026-08-07

An agenda can be wrong as a whole while every ask on it is right.

- Above **five** decisions pitched at the board, the pack says so on the provenance page, in
  the document and on a slide — naming the count and which sections it came from. Five is a
  convention this skill declares, not a standard it cites, so it is named in one constant a
  reader can disagree with rather than buried in a comparison.
- The same failure as the mixed-organisation pack and the hidden conflict: an artifact true on
  every page and unusable as a whole. Ten votes in one sitting does not get ten decisions — it
  gets a few and a queue nobody names. The shipped specimen carries ten, which an external
  retest read as a packaging problem; it is a fixture problem, and the pack now says so itself.
- **It counts and does not choose**, and it suggests no remedy on purpose. Re-pitching an ask
  from `board` to `management` would make the warning vanish and change nothing about the
  exposure; a governance tool that nudges toward relabelling decisions so a deck looks tidier
  is worse than one that stays quiet. Holding an ask back belongs in the minutes, not in an
  `altitude` field.
- Mutation-tested three ways: a warning that never fires, one that counts list length instead
  of altitude, and a threshold of zero each fail a named check. Self-test 132 → **133**,
  assembly 77 → **80**.

## v0.37.1 — 2026-08-07

A model-facing instruction that had been wrong for four releases.

- `skills/board-pack/SKILL.md` still said the applicability profile narrowed
  `incident-materiality` **alone**, and quoted a provenance sentence naming the other four as
  not reading one. That stopped being true at `v0.35.0` and `v0.36.0`. `SKILL.md` is
  operational guidance a model reads *instead of* the implementation, so a stale paragraph
  there is not a typo — it is an instruction to believe something false about four skills.
  Found by external retest, not by us.
- The correction is a check, not a better memory. `assembly.sh` now extracts the blockquote
  from `SKILL.md` and compares it, whitespace-normalised, against the note a real assembly
  writes to the provenance page. It pins no phrase of its own, so when the sentence changes
  because a producer implements the contract, the check fails until the doc is brought along.
  76 → 77 checks.

## v0.37.0 — 2026-08-07

Board prose is bound to the store it describes, and the deck has a board-length mode.

- **`boundTo` in a section sidecar** ties prose to the store state it was written against. A
  register edited after its sidecar produced a pack whose sentences described one state of the
  world and whose numbers described another — `asOf` is a reporting date, not a store version,
  so nothing noticed. Bound and matching is silent; bound and stale warns with both timestamps;
  unbound produces one note for the pack, never one per section.
- **`render_pack.py --deck-mode board`** takes the specimen from 31 slides to 15 before an
  appendix. It **moves and never drops**: the check diffs every text run of both decks, and the
  only thing the board deck does not say is `Section N of 5`.

## v0.36.0 — 2026-08-07

`nist-csf` reads the applicability profile, completing CAC-AP-1 across every register.

- The battery is the **NIST Cyber AI Profile overlay (IR 8596)**, gated on `aiInUse` — and on
  the `secure` and `defend` focus areas only. `thwart` covers attackers using AI against you
  and applies whether or not you use AI at all; gating the whole overlay would have narrowed
  away a question conditional on nothing the profile declares.
- First consumer that **answers** its question: a `.csfp` records the overlay state, so
  disagreement is reported in both directions.
- Fixed: `CONFLICT_KEYS` required `regime`, which a posture conflict does not have, so every
  one would have been rejected as malformed. Fixed: the provenance note vanished entirely once
  every section read a profile.

## v0.35.0 — 2026-08-07

`risk-register`, `metrics-register` and `exceptions-register` read the applicability profile.

- What a profile narrows in a register is the **question set**, not the arithmetic. They ask
  and do not answer, because nothing in these stores records whether a record concerns OT or
  AI, and a coverage figure would be inferred from data that is not there.
- New `business-context/evals/consumers.sh`, which holds every consumer to the contract from
  the side that defines it. It found contract drift on its first run.

## v0.34.0 — 2026-08-07

A polished pack could describe two companies and hide a legal-perimeter conflict.

- **Mixed-organisation packs are refused.** The shipped specimen was itself assembling stores
  belonging to three different fictional firms. Override with an attributed `consolidation`
  block, printed on the provenance page.
- **Applicability conflicts reach the board.** `incident-materiality` reported four `sec-1.05`
  conflicts and the pack dropped all of them, printing "the profile narrowed incident" and
  Form 8-K three times. They now have their own page and slide, before the through-line.

## v0.33.0 — 2026-08-07

`board-pack` reads the applicability profile, so the pack and the worksheet agree.

## v0.32.1 — 2026-08-07

Metrics printed a count with no denominator to read it against.

## v0.32.0 — 2026-08-07

The deck paginated by counting items rather than measuring content, so long prose fell off the
bottom of a slide. New `deck-fit.sh`.

## v0.31.0 — 2026-08-07

Every chart label was measured against a background it never sat on. The contrast checker
resolved SVG text against the page ground rather than the mark behind it, so a band label at
2.62:1 survived four releases with two suites agreeing it was fine.

## v0.30.2 — 2026-08-07

The brand floor scored the cover kicker as decoration rather than as text.

## v0.30.1 — 2026-08-07

Closed the v0.29.0 external retest findings, and one the retest missed.

## v0.30.0 — 2026-08-07

**`business-context`, skill #8**, and the applicability contract **CAC-AP-1**, proved against
one consumer before any others were built on it.

- A `.biz` store: revenue base (exact, rendered banded), crown jewels, board-voiced tolerance,
  obligations — each with a declarer, a date and a basis.
- The profile narrows what other skills ask. **Absence asks more**; a subject declaration
  outranks the profile in both directions; every skipped battery is recorded with its reason.
- `incident-materiality` is the first consumer: SEC Item 1.05 gated on a listed entity, DORA
  windows on declared DORA scope, and the un-narrowed path byte-identical to before.

## v0.29.0 — 2026-08-06

Bands get room when a metric is banded near its ceiling. *(The version an external retest
reviewed; reachable by tag since 2026-08-07.)*

## v0.28.1 — 2026-08-06

The chip and the bullet agree on the boundary.

## v0.28.0 — 2026-08-06

A time axis that is linear in time — the Gantt positioned bars ordinally, not by date.

## v0.27.0 — 2026-08-06

One grid, one palette across every rendered mark.

## v0.26.0 — 2026-08-06

All five skills render under a client brand, with the palette floors enforced at apply time.

## v0.25.0 — 2026-08-06

Attribution comes from one place, and is checked there.

## v0.24.0 — 2026-08-06

`board-pack` notices when two producers escalate the same underlying record — flagged, never
merged.

## v0.23.0 — 2026-08-06

`exceptions-register`: re-measure before you renew. Re-validation is an act with a rationale,
never a timer reset.

## v0.22.0 — 2026-08-06

`incident-materiality` escalates the clocks, and nothing about materiality.

## v0.21.0 — 2026-08-06

`exceptions-register` escalates a lapsed clock, from the skill that owns it.

## v0.20.0 — 2026-08-06

`metrics-register` escalates a breach, and the slip before it.

## v0.19.0 — 2026-08-06

`board-pack` carries the escalations its producers raised — the aggregation no single skill can
do.

## v0.18.1 — 2026-08-06

Documented the second event partition, in the contract and in the skills.

## v0.18.0 — 2026-08-06

**The exposure lifecycle, CAC-EL-1.** `risk-register` raises its own hand: a derived, stateless
escalation record with one shape across the suite. Flag, never block.

## v0.17.0 — 2026-08-05

The pack model carries figures and the producers compute their own — a figure derived in the
assembler is a second number that can disagree with the section above it.

## v0.16.0 — 2026-08-04

**Presentation graphics**: a shared SVG library, a three-way colour contract (RAG / MEASURE /
PATINA), and an editable PowerPoint deck written from `zipfile` with no dependency.

## v0.12.0 — 2026-08-03

Three findings from the v0.11.0 external review.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-07-31

Seven skills, and the refusals they enforce. The first tagged release; see the
[release notes](https://github.com/cyberaware-creations/cac-ciso-toolkit/releases/tag/v0.11.0).

Everything before v0.11.0 predates both tagging and this file. The version strings in the
manifest history are the only record of it, and `git log -- .claude-plugin/plugin.json`
recovers the mapping.
